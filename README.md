# nixos config WIP
This is my personal nixos config.

Currently I'm only testing it in a VM until I have a proper working setup to migrate my main laptop to. There is some terraform code to create that VM locally with libvirt and an initial nix config.

The goal is to migrate all of my dotfiles and system config into nix to have a declarative and reproducible way to setup my personal systems.
